## Architecture in High-Level
The app's entry point is the MainActivity. This Activity contains the NavController that allows the user to navigate the application on the Navigation Graph. In addition, there is a main fragment 'ChatScreenFragment'. The project is aligned with the Android best practice architecture guideline.
** It is important to note that the server functions like a real server and runs locally on the device of the user under port 5433. **

### Package By Feature
Each featureâ€™s architecture has three layers: a data layer, a domain layer and a UI layer.

The architecture follows a reactive programming model with the unidirectional data flow. With the data layer at the bottom, the key concepts are:

- Higher layers react to changes in lower layers.
- Events flow down.
- Data flows up.
